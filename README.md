### The Plan

The idea is to get through the first question of each day. Once I've finished those, I can go through the second part to each question. I'm pretty new to go, and this will hopefully give me a better understanding of how the language works. <br>

I've done some work with concurrency, but now it's time to solve problems. I might also make these YouTube videos, but that's a longshot if we're being honest. I do think it would help me to talk through solving the problems.
